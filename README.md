QRQ_English_Words
=================

Using ebook2cw, this script creates mp3 files of english words for QRQ CW training. 
The files are formatted in a special way, you can change it if you want :-)

Included in this repo, is a list of the most common 5000 english words, sorted.
I use this file as a source, generating the mp3 files.

You need ebook2cw for this to work, installed in the same directory.

ebook2cw has many cool feats, and my script uses only a few of them (by calling
it directly command-like style directly from python). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the
documentation for ebook2cw to learn about it. You can easily use it stand-alone as well
(I guess it was meant for that). Once you know more about it, you can alter my code and add
more functionality.

The code is best run in it's own window, simply double click it..

This is my first version, feel free to play around and change/use it if you want.
There may be updates. Maybe.

Code is Py3, but I'm not using any special libraries/additions beyond the standard install.
I have not included checks for faults or weird user inputs, you'll need to add that yourself,
if you want it (TRY -> EXCEPT, etc)

have fun and best QRQ!
