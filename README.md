QRQ_English_Words
=================

Using ebook2cw, this script creates mp3 files of english words for QRQ CW. 
The files are formatted in a special way, you can change it if you want :-)

You need ebook2cw for this to work, installed in the same directory.
Get it here: http://fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html

The code is best run in it's own window, simply double click it.

This is my first version, feel free to play around and change/use it if you want.

Code is Py3, but I'm not using any special libraries/additions beyond the standard install.
I have not included checks for faults or weird user inputs, you'll need to add that yourself,
if you want it (TRY -> EXCEPT, etc)

have fun and best QRQ!
